    overview: 'Bella Vista was a hidden gem Italian restaurant with amazing food but minimal Facebook presence. With only 500 followers and inconsistent posting, they were losing business to competitors with strong social media. They needed to become the go-to dining destination in their area through Facebook marketing.',
    challenge: 'Minimal Facebook visibility despite great food and reviews. No content strategy, irregular posting (once every 2 weeks), poor photo quality, and zero engagement. Local competitors were dominating Facebook with thousands of followers and full reservations.',
    solution: 'Developed comprehensive Facebook Page strategy with professional food photography, daily engaging content, Facebook Stories showcasing behind-the-scenes, customer testimonials, Facebook Events for special nights, targeted local engagement, and strategic use of Facebook Live for cooking demonstrations.',

They were spending $8K/month with poor returns (2.1x ROAS), generic creatives, and broad targeting. They needed a complete Facebook Ads transformation to make their advertising profitable.',
    challenge: 'Burning ad budget with minimal returns. High cost per purchase ($95), poor ROAS (2.1x), generic ad creatives that didn\'t stand out, broad untested audiences, no retargeting strategy, and Facebook Pixel implementation issues causing tracking problems.',
    solution: 'Complete Facebook Ads rebuild: implemented proper pixel tracking and conversion API, created lifestyle ad creatives showcasing products in beautiful home settings, developed tiered audience strategy (cold, warm, hot), built comprehensive retargeting funnels, launched dynamic product ads, tested video ads vs. images, and implemented A/B testing framework.',
